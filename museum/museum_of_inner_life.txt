Hello, dear companions, welcome to this guided meditation.
Today, we embark on a journey to the inner Museum
This meditation will take about 20 minutes,

Find a comfortable position that suits you, whether lying down or sitting,
and allow yourself to settle into it.
You may choose to gently close your eyes or soften your gaze, whichever
feels most comfortable for you.

Now, take a moment to tune into your breath.
Inhale deeply with a slight smile
feeling the cool air fill your lungs, and exhale slowly,
releasing any tension or stress from your body with a gentle sigh.
Let the breath flow naturally, don´t force it into any rithm.

As you continue to breathe deeply, imagine yourself standing at the entrance of a grand museum.
This is no ordinary museum; it is the inner Museum,
a place where the vast landscape of your mind is curated and displayed.

Visualize the entrance before you, with stairs leading between majestic pillars.
With each step you take towards the entrance,
feel a sense of anticipation and curiosity building.

As you enter the museum, you find yourself in a vast hall
filled with countless pieces of art, some on the floor,
some hanging on the walls. You are all alone in this museum.

These works of art represent your thoughts, emotions, and sensations,
each one a unique expression of your inner world.
Take a moment to observe each of these objects around you.
Notice the colors, shapes, and textures of each one.

Immeadeately your eyes are drawn, to the frames of the paintings on the wall,
they are all made of wood.
Some frames may be light  or a vibrant red, while others may be dark and somber.
Some are spectacularely knotted, some smooth and even.

Notice that the painting may depict a waterfall, but the frame is not wet.
There may be a roaring fire, but the frame is not warm to the touch.
Know that you are free to explore at your own pace,
and that you can always return to the breath if you need to center yourself.

From time to time you notice the gentle sound of bells ringing.
These bells serve as a reminder to return your focus to the rhythm of your breath.
If you notice your mind has wandered or you got engaged with any thought process,
simply acknowledge any thoughts, emotions or sensation that distracted you,
and then gently bring your focus back to the sensation of your breath.
Breath in with a smile, out with a sigh.
And proceed to the next piece of art.


Now notice the images themselves.
Allow yourself to explore each painting or
work of art without judgment,
knowing that there is no right or wrong here,
only a reflection of the complexity of your mind.

With each work of art you encounter, allow yourself
to sink deeper into a state of relaxation and curiosity.
Embrace the diversity of your inner world, knowing that
every thought and emotion has its place
within the vast landscape of your mind.

As you continue to explore, remember that you are
free to engage with any work of art
as much or as little as you like, get as close as you like.

You remeber you´ve been to this museum many times before,
but your attention is drawn to a unfamiliar section of the museum.
It is dimly lit, with a single spotlight illuminating
a large curtain hanging in front of a hall.

As you approach the curtain and go through it
notice a subtle shift in the atmosphere.
The air seems to shimmer with anticipation,
and a gentle mist envelops this space,
veiling and unveiling paintings as you walk.
This mist dances gracefully around you,
creating an ethereal and dreamlike ambiance
that adds to the mystery of this hall.

With each step forward, the mist swirls and shifts,
revealing glimpses of new paintings
hanging on the walls. Some are bathed in soft light,
while others remain shrouded in shadow,
their details obscured by the ever-changing mist.

As you gaze upon the paintings in this special hall,
allow yourself to be captivated by their beauty and complexity.
Each brushstroke tells a story, each color evokes an emotion,
and each composition reveals the depths of your own inner world.

Take your time to wander through the hall,
allowing the mist to guide your journey.

Amidst the array of emotions, you find yourself drawn
to one particular painting. Its colors are muted,
its brushstrokes gentle yet powerful. As you gaze upon it,
a wave of emotion washes over you,
and you find yourself unable to breathe for a moment.

This painting speaks to your very soul,
capturing a period of your life that was heavy with
emotion yet still held moments of beauty and grace.
Memories flood your mind, transporting you
back to that time, and you feel a lump form in your
throat as you struggle to hold back the
emotions that threaten to overwhelm you.

And yet, amidst the heaviness, you discove a glimmer of light,
a thread of beauty that weaves its way through the darkness.
In this moment of vulnerability, you find strength.
You find courage. And as you stand before this
painting, you are filled with a sense of gratitude
for the beauty that exists even in the midst of pain
and sometimes because of it.

Then you hear a bell, you breath in with a smile,
out with a sigh.
There is a sense of peace that washes over you
as you find the strength to move on from this particular painting.

Nearing the end of the hall, you sense a subtle shift in the energy around you.
The mist begins to thin, and a soft glow emanates from the far end of the room.

As you approach the final painting, a sense of inner power washes over you.
You feel a deep connection to the artwork before you,
as if it's speaking directly to you.
You see a powerful symbol of hope and resilience
that radiates from this painting,
filling you with a renewed sense of strength and determination.

Take a moment to bask in the glow of this powerful message, allowing it
to resonate deep within your being. Know that no matter what challenges
you may face, you carry this inner power with you always,
guiding you forward with courage and grace.

You hear a bell, you take a deep breath
and continue your journey,
knowing that you are capable of overcoming any obstacle that comes your way.


As you exit the hall
take another deep breath and slowly begin
to bring your awareness back to the present moment.
Now you exit the museum and sensations of the here and now flood back.
Feel the ground beneath you, the
air on your skin, and the gentle rise and fall of your breath.

When you feel ready, gently open your eyes and
take a moment to reflect on your experience.

Remember that you can return to the inner Museum
whenever you need or want.

I thank you for joining in.
