Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down,
and gently close your eyes. Take a deep breath in through
your nose, feeling your chest and belly expand with air,
and then exhale slowly through your mouth, letting go of
any tension or stress.

Take a few more deep breaths like this, allowing each
inhale to fill you with calm and each exhale to release
any worries or distractions.

Now, bring your awareness to the present moment. Notice
the sensation of your breath as it moves in and out of
your body, the rise and fall of your chest, the rhythm
of your heartbeat. Allow yourself to simply be, without
any need to do or achieve anything.

As you continue to breathe deeply and evenly, consider
the nature of your experience. You are not separate from
the sensations, thoughts, or emotions that arise within you;
rather, you are the sense of curiosity and openness that
focuses attention on them.

Notice any sensations in your body—the feeling of your
feet on the ground, the weight of your body against the
surface that supports you, the gentle rise and fall of your chest with each breath.

Now, bring your awareness to your thoughts. Notice the
stream of thoughts flowing through your mind, like leaves
passing on a river. Instead of getting caught up in any
particular thought, simply observe them as they come and go,
like snowflakes floating by. Don't make the effort of
catching one and watching it melt.

As you continue to observe your thoughts and sensations,
you may begin to notice a sense of spaciousness opening up
within you. This space is where the observer resides—the part
of you that is always present, always aware, and unaffected by
the fluctuations of your inner experience.

The observer within you is not separate from the observed, but
rather part of the same flow of consciousness. This realization
can lead to a deeper understanding of the fluid and ever-changing
nature of your experience, ultimately transcending the illusion
of a fixed and separate self. Remember, this illusion is not
inherently negative—it's beautiful and useful, much like the
illusion of a rainbow or perspective. The ego, too, is not the enemy;
it's a tool that often receives too much attention.

Now, imagine yourself peeling away the layers of conditioning and
perception that obscure your true nature, like peeling away the
layers of an onion. With each layer removed, you come closer to
realizing that there is no core essence of your being. You are
the interplay of layers, like an onion's layers.

Allow yourself to rest in this space of pure awareness, like a
still lake reflecting the beauty of the world around it, adding
to its beauty. Here, there is no need to grasp or cling to anything;
there is no urgency, no fear. From here, there is nowhere to go
because you are in a state of having arrived. Simply allow yourself
to be present, to observe, and to experience the fullness of this moment.

With each breath, feel yourself sinking deeper into this state
of presence and peace. It is not a place you go to; it is the
foundation of the illusion of you. This space of awareness underlies
every other sensation; it is just usually ignored. So now,
when you bring your attention back to the present moment and the
sensation of your breath, try to keep a separate thread of focus on this core.

Take a few more moments to simply be, allowing yourself to fully
embody the deepest levels of this core. And then, clothe yourself
in the illusion of everyday life again. Gently bring your awareness
back to the room around you, slowly opening your eyes and returning
to the present moment.

Take this knowing into your life. Your life is like a book you read.
You can believe in it, take sides with the hero because it's enjoyable.
But it is a book you can close at any moment and return to peace and
presence whenever needed. Allow yourself to carry this sense of calm
and clarity with you as you go about your day.

Just for this today, no longer decide to do or achieve things;
rather, ask yourself: Am I prepared to do what needs to be done?
Can I stay present while doing it? Trust in the unfolding of life,
and allow yourself to be guided by the wisdom of the foundation of you,
which can be found in the present moment..

When any goals finally present themselves,
suspend disbelief for a while, celebrate any beauty you see, any victory you feel
and then look around you at what wants to be done next.  Don´t dwell..
And during this journey, remember this:
knowing the intricate workings of your own mind and body,
recognizing the effort they undergo even to just have you be bored or frustrated,
may allow you to feel thankfulness even in suffering.

This awareness offers a sense of security,
enabling you to be fully present with both the joys and the challenges of life.
You may become more attuned to your own suffering and that of others,
fostering a greater sense of empathy and kindness.
By embracing your own vulnerabilities and struggles,
you cultivate a deeper sense of compassion for yourself and for those around you.

So, be gentle with yourself and others.
Recognize the shared humanity in our experiences,
and let this awareness enrich your life and strengthen your connections.
Allow yourself to carry this sense of thankfulness, attention and gentlensee
with you as you go about your day.

And I thank you for joining in.
