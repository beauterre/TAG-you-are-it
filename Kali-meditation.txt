Introduction:
Take a moment to find a comfortable position,
allowing yourself to settle into a state of relaxation.
Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths,
allowing each inhale to fill you with peace and a gentle smile.
Let the warmth of that smile spread throughout your body,
illuminating any areas of tension and washing
them away with each exhale.

As you continue to breathe deeply,
notice the natural rhythm of your breath.
Playfully lengthen each breath by pausing for a moment
at the end of each inhale and exhale.
Feel how this intentional pause slows your breath,
inviting a sense of calm and tranquility.
Know that with each breath,
you are nourishing your body and mind
with the oxygen it needs,
creating a space of stillness and
relaxation within yourself.


Now, imagine the ancient image of Kali,
the Hindu goddess of time, change, and destruction.
Picture her fierce yet beautiful presence,
with skin as dark as the night sky and
adorned with a garland of skulls,
symbolizing the cycle of life and death.

See her multiple arms, each wielding
a weapon representing her power over
destruction AND creation. In one hand,
she holds a sword to cut through illusion and ignorance,
while in another, she holds a severed head,
signifying the triumph over ego and attachment.

As you envision Kali, feel her energy pulsating around you,
embodying the eternal cycle of creation and destruction.
She is both terrifying and compassionate,
for in her destruction lies the seeds of renewal and transformation.

Imagine Kali engaged in battle with demons,
her ferocity matched only by her determination
to restore balance to the universe.
Among the many foes she faces is Raktabija,
a demon whose blood spawns new clones
with each drop that touches the earth.
But Kali, with her swift movements and long tongue,
prevents his blood from reaching the ground,
neutralizing his power of renewal
enabling the gods to vanquish him.
Kali paves the way for new beginnings.
Allow yourself to be enveloped by Kali's presence
drawing strength from her unwavering resolve
and her reminder that change is an inherent part of existence.
Embrace the transient nature of life,
knowing that from destruction arises the potential for growth and renewal.

Now, let's delve into the concept of transience
by reflecting on the second law of thermodynamics,
which states that entropy, or disorder,
in a closed system always increases over time.
In many ways, Kali embodies this entropy.

According to this law, the fact that we on earth
can create any order at all is due to the sun.
We form one system with this ball of chaos,
and this is the only reason two bricks
will remain on top of each other for a while.
Kali, associated with fire, symbolizes this inevitable force.

Embracing this fundamental principle
reminds us in a scientific way
that change is inevitable and that all things
are subject to the passage of time.
Kali, as entropy, represents the relentless force
behind the cycle of creation and destruction
inherent in the universe.
Just as entropy leads
to the eventual dissolution of order,
Kali's destruction paves the way for
new beginnings and opportunities for growth.

Across cultures, we find stories of creation,
pattern, emerging from chaos.
From the Greek myth of Kaos
giving birth to the cosmos
to the Norse tale of Ymir's body
forming the world in the midst of the void,
Ginnungagap where Yggdrasil stands,
these narratives show the recognition
of the tension between order and chaos.

This is found all around the world
in many different cultures.
In Hindu mythology,
there is the concept of Prakriti,
representing the primal and undifferentiated form of nature
from which all existence arises.
Similarly, in Chinese mythology,
there is the story of Pangu,
emerging from the chaotic egg
to separate yin and yang
and create the heavens and the earth.
These myths from various cultures
underscore the universal theme of
pattern emerging from chaos
and the ongoing struggle between
order and disorder in shaping the world.

In this universe of constant change,
we find ourselves aligned with patterns.
Like life itself,
we are inherently adaptive and renewing,
capable of thriving amidst chaos.
Just as DNA expresses itself over time,
extending the life of species beyond that of mountains,
so too do we unfold and evolve in response to our environment.

Shedding our personal narrative and realigning ourselves
with the side of order in this timeless battle
is a promise echoed in many religions
that offer the prospect of life after death.
It is a reminder of the enduring nature
of the patterns that shape our existence,
and the potential for growth and transformation
that lies is carried by each of us.
Any order we encounter we can recognise
as an ally in this ancient battle.

Let us now strip away the layers of language,
releasing any higher concepts like money, theology, and cultural conditioning.
Temporarily let go of your personal history
and any preconceived notions,
Stop taking a stand against existence
stop doing anything, repress the urgency
of controlling your environment,
controlling what you see as yourself
allowing yourself to see what remains.

Directly experience this kernel of reality,
beyond words or concepts, from which all things arise.
It is a reality that transcends
our ability to speak or even comprehend
a pure essence that underlies existence itself.
Allow yourself to immerse in this moment of pure awareness,
free from the constraints of the mind, and simply be.
Let there not be a breather and breath
In stead be the breathing itself,
happening spontaneously.

From this place of pure potential,
this latent space of possibility,
let us reintroduce the concept of pattern.
As we enter the dance of existence,
patterns emerge in relation to their counterparts
order arises from chaos, and chaos from order,
simultaneously intertwined in the fabric of the universe.
In this eternal dance,
Kali is revealed as the mother of the universe,
inviting creation to the dance floor
through her rhythmic dance of destruction.
Her fierce yet graceful movements symbolize
the perpetual cycle of creation and dissolution,
where endings give rise to new beginnings,
and chaos births order, life.

Sink back into conceptlessness,
allowing yourself to merge with the unity of opposites.
Know that you are not separate from this battle,
this dance of creation and destruction.
Embrace the paradox of existence,
where order and chaos intertwine,
and find solace in the realization
that you are both the dancer and the dance itself.
In this moment of unity,
transcend the limitations of the mind and simply be,
fully immersed in the eternal flow of existence.

Embrace the fluidity of this cosmic dance,
recognizing the interconnectedness of all things
and the ever-present rhythm of change.
In Kali's dance, we find the beauty of
transformation and the promise of renewal,
as each step brings us closer to the heart of existence itself.

As we conclude this meditation,
let us take a moment to honor the transient nature
embracing chaos as part
of the dance of existence,
as embodied by Maa Kali.
Recognize the beauty in
every aspect of your existence,
especially those aspects
your role as the dancer
may urge you to abhor.
In those moments, remember your are the dance.

When you feel ready,
gently bring your awareness
back to the present moment,
carrying with you a deeper understanding
of the interconnectedness of all things.
May this awareness guide you towards an
attitude of tranquility:
one of thankfulness for the beauty of existence,
attentiveness to the rhythms of life, and
gentleness towards yourself and others.

Thankful, attentive, gentle,
TAG, you're it.
