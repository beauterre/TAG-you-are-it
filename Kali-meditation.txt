Introduction:
Take a moment to find a comfortable position,
allowing yourself to settle into a state of relaxation.
Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths,
allowing each inhale to fill you with peace and a gentle smile.
Let the warmth of that smile spread throughout your body,
illuminating any areas of tension and washing
them away with each exhale.

As you continue to breathe deeply,
notice the natural rhythm of your breath.
Playfully lengthen each breath by pausing for a moment
at the end of each inhale and exhale.
Feel how this intentional pause slows your breath,
inviting a sense of calm and tranquility.
Know that with each breath,
you are nourishing your body and mind
with the oxygen it needs,
creating a space of stillness and
relaxation within yourself.

In this perceived end-time of global distress
we need to overcome many tensions to relax
to help you do this
imagine the ancient image of Kali,
the Hindu goddess of time, change, war and destruction.
Picture her fierce yet beautiful presence,
with skin as dark as the night sky and
adorned with a garland of skulls,
symbolizing the cycle of life and death.
You may think her unpleasant, uncomfortable.

See her multiple arms,
each wielding a weapon
representing her unstoppable
power of destruction.
In one hand, she holds a sword
to cut through illusion and ignorance,
while in another, she holds a severed head,
signifying the triumph over ego and attachment.

As you envision Kali,
feel her violent energy pulsating around you,
embodying the eternal cycle of life.
She is terrifying yet compassionate,
for in her destruction
lies the seeds of
renewal and transformation.

Imagine Kali engaged in battle with demons,
her ferocity matched only by her determination
to restore balance to the universe.
Among the many foes she faces is Raktabija,
a demon whose blood spawns new clones
with each drop that touches the earth.
But Kali, with swift movements of her long tongue,
prevents his blood from reaching the ground,
neutralizing his power of renewal
enabling the gods to vanquish him.
Kali paves the way for new beginnings.
Again allow yourself to be enveloped by Kali's presence
now drawing strength from her unwavering resolve
Change is an inherent part of existence.
Embrace the transient nature of life,
knowing that from destruction
arises the potential for growth and renewal.

Now, let's delve into the concept of transience
by reflecting on the second law of thermodynamics,
which states that entropy, or disorder,
in a closed system always increases over time.
In many ways, Kali embodies this entropy.

According to this law in science,
the fact that we on earth
can create any order at all is due to the sun.
We form one system with this source of chaos,
and this is the only reason two bricks
will remain on top of each other for a while
here on earth.
Kali, associated with fire, symbolizes this inevitable force
of the sun, giving birth to order, to life.

Embracing this fundamental principle
reminds us in a scientific way
that change is inevitable and that all things
are subject to the passage of time.
Kali, as entropy, represents this relentless force
behind the cycle of creation and destruction
inherent in the universe.
Just as entropy leads
to the eventual dissolution of any order,
Kali's destruction paves the way for
new beginnings and opportunities for growth
and a new way of being.

Across cultures, we find stories of creation,
pattern, emerging from chaos.
From the Greek myth of Kaos
giving birth to the cosmos
to the Norse tale of Yggdrasil
standing tall inthe midst of the chaotic void,Ginnungagap,
these narratives show the recognition
of the fundamental tension
between order and chaos.

This is found all around the world
across time
in many different cultures.
In Hindu mythology,
there is the concept of Prakriti,
representing the primal
and undifferentiated form of nature
from which all existence arises.
Similarly, in Chinese mythology,
there is the story of Pangu,
emerging from the chaotic egg
to separate yin and yang
and create the heavens and the earth.
These myths from various cultures
underscore the universal theme of
pattern emerging from chaos
and the ongoing struggle between
order and disorder in shaping the world.
This is not a new idea,
it´s an ancient one reemerging.

Because in this universe of constant change,
we find ourselves
naturally aligned with patterns.
For life itself, is a pattern,
a dance of creation and destruction
we are, life is,
inherently adaptive by renewing,
capable of thriving amidst chaos.
Just as DNA expresses itself over time,
extending the life of species
beyond that of mountains,
so too do we unfold and evolve
in response to our environment.

Shedding our personal narrative
and realigning ourselves
with the side of order
in this timeless battle
is a promise echoed in many religions
that offer the prospect of life after death.
Of going on in some form.
It is a reminder of the enduring nature
of the patterns that shape our very existence,
and the potential for growth and transformation
that is carried by each of us.
Any order we encounter we can recognise
as an ally in this ancient battle.

Let us now strip away reality as we learned to see it,
let the immense power of Kali
lift the veil of
cultural conditioning,
burn away the layers of language and symbols.
Temporarily give up the role of the center of your personal narrative
your future, your past
and any preconceived notions you hold in the now
your judgements about things or events
are not needed right now.
For a little while
stop any resistance to existence
stop doing anything for a just moment,
surrender completely to Kali
accept even the urgency
of controlling your environment,
cpntrolling yourself,
choose not to act upon it
allowing yourself to see what remains
when you let go of everything
ever so briefly.
Don´t worry, Kali´s power will keep safe
everything you leave behind until you are
ready to return.
Take a moment to
directly experience this core of reality,
from which all things arise.
Beyond words or concepts,
It is a reality that transcends
comprehension
a pure essence that underlies existence itself.
Allow yourself to immerse in this moment of pure awareness,
free from the constraints of the mind, and simply be.
Let there not be a breather and breath
In stead be the breathing itself,
happening spontaneously,
without effort

From this place of pure potential,
this latent space of possibility,
let us reintroduce just one concept
the concept of pattern.
As we enter the dance of existence,
patterns emerge in relation to their counterparts
as we need contrast to see the edge of anything
order arises from chaos, and chaos from order,
forming each other simultaneously
intertwined in the fabric of the universe.
Entering in this eternal dance,
Kali is revealed as the mother of the universe,
inviting creation to the dance floor
through her rhythmic dance of destruction.
Her fierce yet graceful movements
symbolize the perpetual cycle
of creation and dissolution,
where endings give rise to new beginnings,
and chaos births order,
and the renewal of life.

Sink back into conceptlessness,
allowing yourself to merge with
the unity of opposites again.
Know that you are not separate from this battle,
this dance of creation and destruction.
Embrace the paradox of existence,
where order and chaos intertwine,
and find solace in the realization
that you are both the dancer and the dance itself.
In this moment of unity,
transcend the limitations of the mind and simply be,
fully immersed in the eternal flow of existence.

Embrace the fluidity of this cosmic dance,
recognizing the interconnectedness of all things
and the ever-present rhythm of change.
In Kali's dance, we find the beauty of
transformation and the promise of renewal,
as each step brings us closer to the heart of existence itself.

As we conclude this meditation,
let us take a moment to honor the transient nature
embracing chaos as part
of the dance of existence,
as embodied by Maa Kali.
Recognize the beauty in
every aspect of your existence,
especially those aspects
your role as the dancer
may urge you to abhor.
In those moments, remember your are the dance and
the dancer.
two truths that cannot exist
without each other

When you feel ready,
gently bring your awareness
back to the present moment,
carrying with you a deeper understanding
of the interconnectedness of all things.
May this awareness guide you towards an
attitude of tranquility:
one of thankfulness for the beauty of existence,
attentiveness to the rhythms of life, and
gentleness towards yourself and others.

Thankful, attentive, gentle,
TAG, you're it.
