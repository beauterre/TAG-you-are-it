Mamma nkiru

Sit with mama nkiru for a while, child.

How wonderful that we can share this time and place
In this sanctuary of safety, let us embrace the rhythms
of the world and find solace in its ever-changing embrace
And right now the time has come, to heal and rest.

You appear burdened, child, as if a dream has slipped through your fingers
But do not let the absence of that dream cloud your vision of what is.

Child, close your eyes and breathe deeply

Feel the rhythm of your breath, the steady beat of your heart.
Feel the pulse of life within you, beating in harmony with the universe.
In this moment, there is only you and the universe,
connected in a dance as old as time itself.

As you breathe, release the weight of yesterday's sorrows and tomorrow's worries,
Be present in this moment,
fully immersed in the sacredness of our shared space.

You may have lost a dream, child, but you have not lost yourself.
Your memories of better times are not anchors weighing you down,
but beacons lighting the path forward.
Embrace them, cherish them, but do not let them define you.

Look around you, child, and see the wonder that surrounds you.
In the rustle of leaves, the song of birds,
the gentle caress of the breeze, there is beauty beyond measure.
See the beauty in the dance of sunlight through the canopy.
Open your heart to it, let it fill you with gratitude and awe.

Know that life is a journey of constant change,
Embrace the flow of life's currents,
finding strength in the ebb and flow of joy and sorrow
knowing that each moment is a precious gift.

Now feel the earth beneath you
like the steady beat of a drum,
Let it infuse you with strength and resilience.
Now, let us journey together into the depths of your soul
Exploring the shadows within,
and embracing the light that shines brightly at your core

With you world eyes closed,
open your dream eyes and see a sacred grove,
surrounded by towering trees and dancing shadows.
The air is alive with the hum of cicadas and the
whisper of leaves, a symphony of nature's rhythm.

I´ll be by your side, as you explore the depths of your soul,
confronting the shadows and embracing the light within.
I´ll guides you through the labyrinth of your emotions,
encouraging you to release the pain and fears that weigh heavy on your heart.

In this sacred space, there is no judgment,
only acceptance and love.
I hold space for your healing journey,
offering my wisdom and guidance
as you navigate the turbulent waters of life.

And as you emerge from the depths of meditation,
carry with you the resilience of Mama Nkiru,
knowing that within you lies the strength to face
whatever challenges may come your way.
Nkiru means, "the best is yet to come,"
let it echo in your heart,
as you step forward with renewed purpose and determination,
ready to embrace the ever-changing rhythms of the world.

Now close your dream eyes
release the grip of longing and embrace the beauty of the present moment.
drop the burden of unmet expectations, let it slowly dissipate.
Don´t dwell on what could have been,
for it only serves to obscure the wonders
that surround you in the here and now.

shift your perspective, allowing yourself to fully
immerse in the richness of the present experience.
You open your eyes to the beauty that exists in every moment,
finding solace in the memories of the past without letting them
overshadow the beauty of the present.

Now open your world eyes and
embrace the wonder of the world as it unfolds before you.
